# The Best TLS Training in the World

Spend two days to understand both the theory and practice of SSL/TLS and Internet PKI

Designed by the author of the much acclaimed [*Bulletproof SSL and TLS*](https://www.feistyduck.com/books/bulletproof-ssl-and-tls/), this practical training course will teach you how to deploy secure servers and encrypted web applications and understand both the theory and practice of Internet PKI.

The course is taught in small classes. Also available [on-site](mailto:training@feistyduck.com) and as a remote option for in-house teams.


## Why This Course is for You

- Understand threats and attacks against encryption
- Identify real risks that apply to your systems
- Deploy servers with strong private keys and valid certificates
- Deploy TLS configurations with strong encryption and forward secrecy
- Understand higher-level attacks against web applications
- Use the latest defence technologies, such as HSTS, CSP, and HPKP
- Learn about key PKI standards and formats
- Understand where practice differs from theory
- Analyze certificate lifecycle in detail
- Evaluate PKI weaknesses and how they affect you
- Deploy robust protection using public key pinning
- Learn about what's coming in the future

## Course Outline

On day 1, we’ll focus on what you need in your daily work to deliver best security, availability and performance. And you will learn how to get an A+ on SSL Labs! On day 2, we will start with the basics and the theory, then discuss how the PKI is implemented in the real world, and finish with a practical example of a realistic private certification authority.
